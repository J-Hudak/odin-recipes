        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided </li>
        <li>4 portobello mushroom caps, sliced</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can beef broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry Marsala wine</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon browning sauce</li>
        <li>kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch thickness </li>
        <li>1 pinch kosher salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt 4 tablespoons butter and heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the mushroom slices in the skillet until tender. Remove pan from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter and heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the garlic and cook until tender, then gradually whisk in 1 tablespoon flour. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to high, and whisk in the beef broth, Marsala, and browning sauce. Season sauce with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Bring sauce to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Mix in the cooked mushrooms; you'll use the skillet to cook the chicken. Cover saucepan and remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper, and dredge chicken breasts in the flour. Over medium heat, melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter in the skillet used to cook the mushrooms. Cook the chicken 2 minutes per side, until browned. Arrange the chicken in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish, and cover with the sauce and mushroom mixture.</li>
        <li>Cover baking dish, and bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until chicken juices run clear.</li>
        

    </ol>
